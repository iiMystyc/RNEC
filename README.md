# RNEC
RNEC (Random Number Equality Checker) is a random project I originally made in Python to test my skills.
# Usage
cmake .<br>
make<br>
./rnec<br>
<br>
It's as easy as that! Unless there's a tinsey little problem you'll spend a couple hours working out. :)<br>
If you can't use threading for whatever fuck all reason, you can take out ``void _status()`` and rewire the whole message queue thing I had going on.<br>
This project is made up of alot of StackOverflow and tears, is you wanna support my progress, all you gotta do is nothing! I hate this.<br>
Have fun!
