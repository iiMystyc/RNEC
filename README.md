# RNEC
RNEC (Random Number Equality Checker) is a random project i originally made in python to test my skills.
# Usage
cmake .
make
./rnec

its as easy as that! unless theres a tinsey little problem you'll spend a couple hours working out. :)
if you cant use threading for whatever fuck all reason, you can take out ``void _status()`` and rewire the whole message queue thing i had going on.
have fun!
