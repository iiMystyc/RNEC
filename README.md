# RNEC
RNEC (Random Number Equality Checker) is a random project i originally made in python to test my skills.
# Usage

make<br>
./rnec<br>

its as easy as that! unless theres a tinsey little problem you'll spend a couple hours working out. :)<br>
if you cant use threading for whatever fuck all reason, you can take out ``void _status()`` and rewire the whole message queue thing i had going on.<br>
this projects is made up of alot of stack overflow and tears, is you wanna support my progress, all you gotta do is nothing! i hate this.<br>
have fun!
